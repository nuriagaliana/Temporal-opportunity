Habitat area structures ecological networks through temporal opportunities

This repository contains all code and data for the manuscript "Habitat area structures ecological networks through temporal opportunities" by Nuria Galiana and Malena Sabatino.

Overview
This study reveals that temporal opportunity—the availability of interaction partners through time—is a key mechanism linking habitat area to ecological network architecture. Analyzing 12 plant-pollinator networks from isolated rocky hills in Argentina (13-2,100 ha), we demonstrate that larger habitats support extended flowering seasons, creating more temporal interaction opportunities that translate into more complex and robust networks.

Contents

Data: Plant-pollinator interaction networks and phenological observations from the 2007-2008 flowering season across 12 sierras in the Tandilian system, Argentina

Code: Complete R scripts for all analyses and figure generation

- Network structure analysis (species richness, links, degree distributions)
- Degree distribution fitting (power-law and truncated power-law models)
- Temporal opportunity analyses (phenophase duration, temporal overlap, potential partners)
- Beta diversity analysis (temporal and spatial dissimilarity)
- Statistical tests and model fitting

Key Findings

Larger habitats provide extended flowering seasons and more temporal interaction opportunities.
Pollinator degree distributions become flatter with area (lower power-law exponents), indicating stronger hub structure.
Temporal opportunities translate into realized interactions for mobile pollinators but not sessile plants.
High temporal turnover (77-92% dissimilarity) creates ephemeral interaction windows.

Data Availability
All datasets are included in this repository. Original data collection is described in Sabatino et al. (2010) Ecological Applications 20:1491-1497.
